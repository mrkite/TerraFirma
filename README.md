Cross-platform mapping for Terraria

COMPILING:
----------

All Platforms:
Use QtCreator and open terrafirma.pro


How to do a static compile on Windows:
-------------------------------------

Download the qt5.5 sourcecode.

Unzip it whereever you wish, it's a large file and contains a lot of nested
subdirectories, so you'll probably want to put it in <samp>C:\Qt5\src</samp> or something
similar since you could end up running into Windows' path-length limitations
otherwise.

Now edit <samp>qtbase\mkspecs\common\msvc-desktop.conf</samp>

Find the CONFIG line and remove embed_manifest_dll and embed_manifest_exe
from that line.

Next find `QMAKE_CFLAGS_*` and change `-MD` to `-MT` and `-MDd` to `-MTd`.

Open your developer command prompt, cd into the qtbase folder and run:

```bat
>configure -prefix %CD% -debug-and-release -opensource -confirm-license -platform win32-msvc2013 -nomake tests -nomake examples -opengl desktop -static
>nmake
```

If nmake complains about python or perl, install ActivePerl and ActivePython and
try again.  This compile will take forever.

This should make a static Qt5 with both debug and release libraries.  Now in
QtCreator go to Tools â†’ Options and select Qt Versions from Build & Run.
Add a new Qt Version and locate the `qmake.exe` inside <samp>qtbase\bin</samp>.  Then
create a new Kit that uses the Qt Version you just created.

Building for Linux:
-------------------

Use qmake to generate a makefile then run make.

To make a package,

```console
$ debuild
```

To make a package for another distrubtion

```console
$ pbuilder-dist vivid create  # generate the environment
$ debuild -S -us -uc
$ cd ..
$ pbuilder-dist vivid build *.dsc
```

Building on macOS/OSX:
----------------

NEW 2019 Updated Instructions:

Use the Homebrew package manager and install Qt:

```console
$ brew install qt5
```

Then use qt5 to run qmake and compile:

```console
(Note--path may be slightly different, if qt has been updated)
$ /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.12.0/bin/qmake
$ make
$ open terrafirma.app
```

OLD Instructions:

Make a static compile of Qt 5.5:

```console
$ git clone https://code.qt.io/qt/qt5.git
$ cd qt5
$ perl init-repository --module-subset=default,-qtwebkit,-qtwebkit-examples,-qtwebengine
(wait forever)
$ git checkout 5.5
$ ./configure -prefix $PWD -opensource -confirm-license -nomake tests -nomake examples -release -static
$ make
(wait forever)
```

Then compile Terrafirma:

```console
$ cd TerraFirma
$ ~/qt5/qtbase/bin/qmake
$ make
```
